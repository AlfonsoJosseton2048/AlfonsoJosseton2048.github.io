## How to play
A 2048 game is played in a **4x4 board**, where you will have several numbers...<br>
All you need to do is to **merge identical numbers**, this way you can reach higher values.<br>
As the game name says, you will get the **victory** once the **2048 value is reached**.

At the beginning you'll get only two numbers (could have a value of 2, like in the image, or 4).<br>
You can **merge the numbers by using the arrows keys**:

You can also merge the numbers by doing the **swipe gesture**, specially for mobile phones:

Using the arrows or the swipe gesture could make some cells collide, but that event also moves all the numbers in the specified direction:

Everytime you press an arrow key or use an swipe gesture, **if you move or collide any cell, a new number will appear!** This way you collect more and more numbers...

If you 'collect' :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: as many numbers as cells has the board, then you are in trouble!! :warning: <br>
If you still have any move where you can collide cells you're still alive, but it will be hard to get out of that situation  :expressionless:

<br>
The moment where you can't do any move (thus, the board is totally occuppied by numbers) you're not in trouble but totally defeated :wink:
